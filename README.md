🎥 Movie Mood Recommender

Lights, camera, recommendation! 🎬 Craving the perfect film to match your current vibe? Look no further than the Movie Mood Recommender. This is your go-to source for discovering cinematic gems tailored to your specific mood. Whether you're feeling happy, sad, adventurous, or romantic, we'll help you find the ideal movie to enhance your experience.

Welcome to the Movie Mood Recommender – a beginner-friendly ML project that suggests movies based on your mood using both pre-trained NLP and a custom-trained ML model.

**INTRODUCTION**:
With so much content to watch on streaming platforms, selecting a movie to watch can be daunting. With so many options, viewers find it difficult to pick something that reflects their mood at the moment. This project addresses that by coming up with a smart and intuitive Movie Mood Recommender system.By leveraging the capability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), this app identifies a user's mood from a basic sentence. It then suggests movies that resonate with that feeling — whether the user is feeling happy, sad, romantic, motivated, bored, or otherwise. The app also supports more than 80 distinct moods and uses a hand-picked corpus of mood-tagged movies to make very individual recommendations. An option to toggle between using a pre-trained TextBlob model and a custom-trained Naive Bayes classifier.This is a beginner-friendly project, deployable on Streamlit Cloud, and does not need any machine learning knowledge to execute.
It's perfect for students, developers, and movie lovers who want to dive into AI-fueled personalization. With a single click, your mood becomes your movie matchmaker.
Let your emotions be your guide in cinema! ????️✨

🧠 **Technologies and Tools Used**
This project combines modern machine learning, natural language processing, and web development tools to create a seamless, real-time movie recommendation experience:
**Technology	Purpose**
🐍 Python:	Core programming language used throughout the project
🧾 Pandas:	Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation for movies.csv
🔢 Scikit-learn	:Training a Naive Bayes classifier and vectorizing text using CountVectorizer
🧠 TextBlob: Pre-trained sentiment analysis for rule-based mood detection
💻 Streamlit: Web framework for building and deploying the interactive UI
💾 Joblib: Saving and loading the ML model and vectorizer
📊 NumPy: Efficient handling of arrays and numerical operations (if needed)
📁 CSV Dataset: Contains 1000+ mood-tagged movie entries
These tools were selected to ensure that the system is:
Easy to use 💡
Fast to prototype ⚡
Beginner-friendly 🎓
Ready for deployment 🚀

**📊 Data Descriptions**
The movies.csv file is a structured dataset used to map movies to specific moods. It contains information such as movie titles, mood labels, genre, and release year. Each row in the dataset represents one movie.
Below is a breakdown of the key features:
Column Name	Description
🎞 Title:The name of the movie (e.g., La La Land, Inception)
🎭 Mood: The emotion associated with the movie (e.g., happy, sad, romantic, motivated)
🎬 Genre: The primary genre of the movie (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Action, Sci-Fi)
📅 Year: The release year of the movie (e.g., 2006, 2022)
🧠 These mood tags are used to filter and recommend relevant movies based on the predicted emotional tone of the user's input.

**Features**
🎭 Detects your mood from a sentence using TextBlob or a Naive Bayes classifier
🍿 Recommends movies based on mood (e.g., happy, sad, romantic, motivated)
🧠 Switch between pre-trained and custom ML models
🌐 Deployable on Streamlit Cloud
💡 No prior ML knowledge needed to run!

**📦 Import Statements**
"import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from mood_model import detect_mood
from ml_model_predictor import predict_mood"

streamlit: Used to create the interactive web UI.
pandas: To read and process the movies.csv file.
detect_mood: Function using TextBlob for basic mood detection.
predict_mood: Function using a trained ML model (Naive Bayes) to detect mood.

**🎬 Main App Content**
st.title("Movie Mood Recommender")
st.markdown(f"👤 Logged in as: `{st.session_state['username']}`")
**💬 Mood Input & Detection**
user_input = st.text_input("How are you feeling right now?")
use_custom_model = st.checkbox("Use Custom Trained Model")
**🧠 Predict Mood & Filter Recommendations**
mood = predict_mood(...) or detect_mood(...)

    st.error(f"Error loading movie data: {e}")

**✅ Summary of custom_model.py**
moods:List of mood labels the model can recognize
sample_text:Basic sentence for each mood to simulate input
CountVectorizer:Converts text to numerical features
MultinomialNB: Trains a text classification model
joblib: Saves model and vectorizer for later use
model.pkl, vectorizer.pkl: Used in the Streamlit app to detect moods

**✅ Summary of ml_model_predictor.py**
predict_mood()	Combines both: preprocesses input and outputs the predicted mood
model.pkl: A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained to classify text into one of 80+ moods.
vectorizer.pkl: A CountVectorizer trained on the same text used during model training — it converts input text into the correct numerical format (bag-of-words).
def predict_mood(text):
Defines a function that accepts one input — the user's text (e.g., "I'm feeling excited and motivated!").
X = vectorizer.transform([text])
Converts the input string into a format that the model understands:
vectorizer.transform() tokenizes the input based on the vocabulary learned during training.
[text] wraps the string in a list because the model expects a list or array of inputs.
return model.predict(X)[0]
Uses the trained model to predict the mood of the input.
.predict(X) returns a list/array of predictions, so [0] takes the first result.

**✅ Summary Table of mood_model.py**
Strategy: Method Used: Output Example
Keyword match:"furious", "rage":angry
Keyword match:"wholesome", "sweetheartwarming
Polarity > 0.6	(very positive)	happy
Polarity < -0.5	(very negative)	sad
No strong signal	(neutral tone)	neutral

🛠 Future Improvements
Add real-time movie API (e.g., TMDb)
Personalize recommendations
Add more moods and a bigger dataset
